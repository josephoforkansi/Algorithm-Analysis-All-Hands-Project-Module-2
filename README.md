# 😊 All Hands Project 2

## 🔬 Research Question

**What are the performance differences between Singly Linked List (SLL) Queue, Doubly Linked List (DLL) Queue and Array-based Queue implementations when executing basic operations.**

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project benchmarks queue data structures to analyze their efficiency across basic operations. The implementation is structured within the analyze project.

## ➡️➡️➡️ Queue Implementations

- Singly Linked List (SLL) Queue - Implemented in sll_queue.py

- Doubly Linked List (DLL) Queue - Implemented in dll_queue.py

- Array-based Queue - Implemented in array_queue.py

##  Basic Operations Implemented

- enqueue(value): Adds an element to the back of the queue.

- dequeue(): Removes and returns the front element of the queue.

- peek(): Returns the front element without removing it.

- add(+): Merges two queues into a new queue.

- iadd(+=): Performs in-place merging of two queues.

Each queue implementation includes methods for:

- addFirst(value): Adds an element to the front of the queue.

- addLast(value): Adds an element to the back of the queue.

- removeFirst(): Removes and returns the front element of the queue.

- removeLast(): Removes and returns the last element of the queue.

- __add__: Implements the + operation for merging two queues.

- __iadd__: Implements the += operation for in-place merging.

## Supporting Tasks

- Benchmarking & Performance Testing (benchmark.py): Compares execution times for queue operations.

- Test Cases (test_cases.py): Unit tests verifying correctness of implementations.

- README Documentation (README.md): Describes implementation, approach, and results.

- Data Collection: Gathering and analyzing performance metrics.

## ✅ Running the Project

To run the program

- `cd analyze && poetry install`

To run just the analyze

- `poetry run analyze analyze`

To run doubling experiment

- `poetry run analyze doubling`

You can also run the commands below for a more detailed approach:

- `poetry run analyze --help`
- `poetry run analyze analyze --help`
- `poetry run analyze doubling --help`

## 📄 Results & Findings

The benchmarking results will provide insights into the performance trade-offs between SLL, DLL, and Array-based queue implementations. These results will be documented and analyzed as part of the project conclusion.
